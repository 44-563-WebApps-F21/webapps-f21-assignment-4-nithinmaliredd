    <h3> ACT III. _The Library of Lord Goringâ€™s House in Curzon Street_.</h3>
    <p>[Enter LORD GORING in evening dress with a buttonhole.  _He is
        wearing a silk hat and Inverness cape_.  White-gloved, _he carries a
        Louis Seize cane_.  His are all the delicate fopperies of Fashion.
        One sees that he stands in immediate relation to modern life, _makes it
        indeed_, and so masters it.  _He is the first well-dressed philosopher
        in the history of thought_.]</p>
        
         <h5>LORD GORING.</h5> <p>Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps?</p>
        
         <h5>PHIPPS.</h5> <p> Yes, my lord.  <p>[Takes his hat, cane, and cape, _and
        presents new buttonhole on salver_.]</p></p>
        
        <h5>LORD GORING.</h5>  <p>Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person
        of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole.</p>
        
        <h5>PHIPPS.</h5>  <p>Yes, my lord.  I have observed that.</p>
        
        <h5>LORD GORING.</h5>  <p> <p>[Taking out old buttonhole.]</p>  You see, Phipps, Fashion is
        what one wears oneself.  What is unfashionable is what other people wear.</p>
        
        <h5>PHIPPS.</h5>  <p>Yes, my lord.</p>
        
        <h5>LORD GORING.</h5>  <p>Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.</p>
        
        <h5>PHIPPS.</h5>  <p>Yes, my lord.</p>
        <h5>LORD GORING.</h5> <p> <p>[Putting in a new buttonhole.]</p>  And falsehoods the truths
        of other people.</p>
        
        <h5>PHIPPS.</h5>  <p>Yes, my lord.</p>

        <h5> LORD GORING. </h5> <p>[_Holds up letter in pink envelope_.] </p> 
        <p>  Ahem! Phipps, when did this letter arrive? </p>

        <h5>PHIPPS. </h5>  <p>It was brought by hand just after your lordship went to the club.</p>
