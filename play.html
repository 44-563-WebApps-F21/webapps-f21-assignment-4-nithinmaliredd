    <h3> ACT III. _The Library of Lord Goring’s House in Curzon Street_.</h3>
    <p>
        <br>_The Library in Lord Goring’s house_ <br>
        LORD GORING. Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps?<br>

        PHIPPS. Yes, my lord. [_Takes his hat_, _cane_, _and cape_, _and
        presents new buttonhole on salver_.]<br>

        LORD GORING. Rather distinguished thing, Phipps. I am the only person
        of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole.<br>

        PHIPPS. Yes, my lord. I have observed that.<br>

        LORD GORING. [_Taking out old buttonhole_.] You see, Phipps, Fashion is
        what one wears oneself. What is unfashionable is what other people wear.<br>

        PHIPPS. Yes, my lord.<br>

        LORD GORING. Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.<br>

        PHIPPS. Yes, my lord.<br>

        LORD GORING. [_Putting in a new buttonhole_.] And falsehoods the truths
        of other people.<br>

        PHIPPS. Yes, my lord.<br>

        LORD GORING. Other people are quite dreadful. The only possible society
        is oneself.<br>

        PHIPPS. Yes, my lord.<br>

        LORD GORING. To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance,
        Phipps.<br>

        PHIPPS. Yes, my lord.<br>

        LORD GORING. [_Looking at himself in the glass_.] Don’t think I quite
        like this buttonhole, Phipps. Makes me look a little too old. Makes me
        almost in the prime of life, eh, Phipps?<br>

        PHIPPS. I don’t observe any alteration in your lordship’s appearance.<br>

        LORD GORING. You don’t, Phipps?<br>

        PHIPPS. No, my lord.<br>

        LORD GORING. I am not quite sure. For the future a more trivial
        buttonhole, Phipps, on Thursday evenings.<br>

        PHIPPS. I will speak to the florist, my lord. She has had a loss in her
        family lately, which perhaps accounts for the lack of triviality your
        lordship complains of in the buttonhole.<br>

        LORD GORING. Extraordinary thing about the lower classes in England—they
        are always losing their relations.<br>

        PHIPPS. Yes, my lord! They are extremely fortunate in that respect.<br>

        LORD GORING. [_Turns round and looks at him_. PHIPPS _remains
        impassive_.] Hum! Any letters, Phipps?<br>

        PHIPPS. Three, my lord. [_Hands letters on a salver_.]<br>

        LORD GORING. [_Takes letters_.] Want my cab round in twenty minutes.<br>

        PHIPPS. Yes, my lord. [_Goes towards door_.]<br>

        LORD GORING. [_Holds up letter in pink envelope_.] Ahem! Phipps, when
        did this letter arrive?<br>

        PHIPPS. It was brought by hand just after your lordship went to the
        club.<br>
